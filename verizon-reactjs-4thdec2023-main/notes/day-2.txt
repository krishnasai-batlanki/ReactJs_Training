modules in JavaScript:
a. module
b. module format
	1. common js format (default module format for node js)
		export: module.exports = { propName: memberName }
		import: const obj = require('module-name')

	2. ES6 module format:
		 export: export member
		 import: import { member } from 'module'

	3. AMD (asynchronous module definition)
		define(
			'',[], function(){
				
			}
		)

	4. UMD (Universal module definition)
		require()

c. module loader:
	the one, who understands the import/export format and resolves dependencies amongst files and then load the files accordingly
	ex: require js, system js, curl js, steal js etc.
	common js module loader is by default part of node js runtime

a module object represents information about a file in node runtime
when any file is loaded in node runtime, the module object for that file is created by node runtime

Note: broswer does NOT have any module loader
solution: supply module loader s/w to browser
